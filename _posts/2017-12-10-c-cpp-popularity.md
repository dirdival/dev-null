title: "C/C++ popularity"
---

It's good idea to from time to time check that you're not a dinosaur. Computer
science, IT since many years is one of the fastest growing sectors. You should
track trends to not stay behind. Usually near to end of the year I make small
research to find out what happens on _language market_. Measuring programming
language popularity isn't new idea, each sector of market has similar statistics.
I'm not going to make my own measurements, in the internet you can find many
sites which make them since many years. Let's find out what most popular
[indexes][link_wikipedia_mplp] say about `C/C++`.

---

According to the [`TIOBE Programming Community Index`][link_TIOBE] is not so
bad with `C/C++`. They are still on the top of the list but longer trend shows
that popularity of them falling down. Also, not surprising information, the
most popular language is `Java` -- mostly used by _big players_.

---

If we look at report made by [PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language][link_PYPL]
focused only on `Google Trends` than we can see a little different statistics.
Again, on the top is `Java`, but this time after it we have `Python`, `PHP`, `Javascript`. 
I think that it better shows current market, demanding _internet solutions_.

---

[RedMonk ranking][link_red_monk] is derived from `GitHub`. 10 top languages
are mostly the same but leader has changed. This time it's `Javascript` and
after that we see other _internet languages_: `Java`, `Python`, `PHP`.  Moreover,
`C/C++` are far away from top but they are still present in first ten. Also,
this ranking contains some deviation from _language meaning_ because it calls
`CSS` as _programming lanugage_. Followed the `google` I visited similar _ranking page_ which takes
data from `GitHub` -- [stackify][link_stackify]. I add it just for fun, because
they have extended meaning of programming language. You can find there: `CSS`, `TeX`, `VimL`, etc.

I think that we have enough data to make a summary of `C/C++` popularity. It
looks like that nothing has changes since last year. Still they are on the top.
_Market_ of languages split into two pieces long time ago -- we have _internet languages_
which allow write web pages and network things quickly. Second part takes _low level
langues_ like `C/C++` used to write operating systems and other quick applications.
Moreover, I'm still waiting for moment when _internet of things_ blossoms. From obvious
reasons they have to be done on low-cost _machines_ with low CPU/memory usage.
I my opinion renascence of `C/C++` might come much sooner that many people think.
