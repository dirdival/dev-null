title: "XMP"

_Does RAM frequency matter?_ I have seen many times this question on different forums.
Because I have a _RAM_ which might be overclocked I will try answer on this question.
By default _BIOS_ has disabled [_Extreme Memory Profile (XMP)_][link_xmp] and it means that _RAM_ frequency is 2133 MHz.
You can check your current set up in this way:

	$ sudo dmidecode --type 17 | grep -E '(Speed|Rank)'
	Speed: 2134 MHz
	Rank: 2
	Configured Clock Speed: 1067 MHz
	Speed: 2134 MHz
	Rank: 1
	Configured Clock Speed: 1067 MHz
	Speed: 2134 MHz
	Rank: 2
	Configured Clock Speed: 1067 MHz
	Speed: 2134 MHz
	Rank: 1
	Configured Clock Speed: 1067 MHz

Because I'm a programmer for me memory is like an array. One of the most common action
executed on it is copying data -- in this case _C/C++_ developers use mostly _memcpy()_.
To resolve _mystery_ we need only make measurements of copying data before and after change of _RAM_ frequency.
Fortunately we have command line tool
[_mbw (Memory BandWidth benchmark)_][link_mbw], it should be available on your Linux distribution. _Mbw_ allows us gather results easily:

    $ mbw -n 100 -t0 4096
    Long uses 8 bytes. Allocating 2*536870912 elements = 8589934592 bytes of memory.
    Getting down to business... Doing 100 runs per test.

    2	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.69368	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 5904.782 MiB/s
    ...
    98	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.69471	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 5896.002 MiB/s
    99	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.69302	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 5910.406 MiB/s
    AVG	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.69311	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 5909.561 MiB/s

On default configuration average value of copying data took _5909 MB/s_. (BTW, I don't like unit MiB).
Let's find out how it looks like after change.
I enabled in _BIOS_ _XMP_ option and I've chosen frequency 2800.

System recognised and confirmed change:

	$ sudo dmidecode --type 17 | grep -E '(Speed|Rank)'
	Speed: 2800 MHz
	Rank: 2
	Configured Clock Speed: 1400 MHz
	Speed: 2800 MHz
	Rank: 1
	Configured Clock Speed: 1400 MHz
	Speed: 2800 MHz
	Rank: 2
	Configured Clock Speed: 1400 MHz
	Speed: 2800 MHz
	Rank: 1
	Configured Clock Speed: 1400 MHz

And again I made the same test:

    $ mbw -n 100 -t0 4096
    Long uses 8 bytes. Allocating 2*536870912 elements = 8589934592 bytes of memory.
    Getting down to business... Doing 100 runs per test.

    1	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.60810	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 6735.701 MiB/s
    2	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.60853	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 6730.930 MiB/s
    ...
    98	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.60794	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 6737.540 MiB/s
    99	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.60724	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 6745.263 MiB/s
    AVG	Method: MEMCPY	Elapsed: 0.60777	MiB: 4096.00000	Copy: 6739.396 MiB/s

According to data, after change frequency, function _memcpy()_ is able copy _~800MB_ more in the same time.
The time has come to answer on questions.
Is it better result? Obvious -- yes. Do I feel that desktop work faster? Truly -- no. 
First, machine contains many units: _CPU_, _GPU_, _RAM_, disks and other. They cooperate together. If any
of them is bottleneck then boosting the weakest link always have sense. Does _RAM_ might be bottleneck?
Answer is -- as always -- it depends. If you don't have a lot memory and your desktop is swapping memory,
overclocking _RAM_ doesn't help. Even if you have the fastest _RAM_ but you read data from slow disk then
memory is filled slowly. You can see gain of change only when you work with huge amount of data, stored
in memory, otherwise it's only a feature which nice to have.
