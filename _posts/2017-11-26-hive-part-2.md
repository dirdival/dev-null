title: "Hive (part 2)"
---

I's continuation of [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-19-hive %}) about `Hive`. The first part focused on developers, environment and tools. This time I'm going to look deeper into code.

# Erratum

In the first post about `Hive` I wrote about accounts. Each commit contains information about author like: `User #140 <Account.155@devlan.net>`. It looks
a bit strange, isn't it? This unusual form niggled me. I couldn't imagine that developers use only ID and talk about a code in this way: _Did you see what
\#140 made in foo.c? What a bummer!_ I made a deeper investigation and after few minutes all was clear. Data are malformed.

Someone from `wikileaks` obfuscated data, small prove `.git/logs/HEAD`:

It took more or less 3 days.
```
dirdival@pld:~$ python3
>>> import time

time.struct_time(tm_year=2017, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=21, tm_hour=9, tm_min=42, tm_sec=53, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=294, tm_isdst=0)

```
BTW, do you recognize the time zone? If not follow previous post.
Did he make obfuscation well? Fortunately, he doesn't know git like I do. Even if you remove or change something all data are still stored in git objects. I checked them
all and I found _hidden_ things.

Let's now look under the hood:

```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git cat-file -p  54bb023b7b95908455dddbc1b4ca984cd484e095
tree 8392a8140d924018067ef4ece3c2260c7427784d

committer User #140 <Account.155@devlan.net> 1377009112 -0400

Added files and directories related to Eclipse IDE.
```
nailed:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git cat-file -p a4bddadd3678dcdd96c075a96fa725f5b92c685a
tree 8392a8140d924018067ef4ece3c2260c7427784d

committer Jack M <jack@neutrino.edb.devlan.net> 1377009112 -0400

Added files and directories related to Eclipse IDE.
```

It wasn't too hard to collect all data and uncover real emails. Mapping:
```
User #140 <Account.155@devlan.net> - Jack M <jack@neutrino.edb.devlan.net>
User #142 <Account.156@devlan.net> - Jack M <jackmc@devlan.net>
User #217 <Account.227@devlan.net> - miker <user@hive-builder.edb.devlan.net>
User #226 <Account.233@devlan.net> - miker <miker@localhost.localdomain>
User #226 <Account.234@devlan.net> - miker <miker@stash.devlan.net>
User #226 <Account.235@devlan.net> - miker <miker@devlan.net>
```

How you can see on this repo work two developers, but they use different
machines to commit data. According to emails both of them are team members of `Embedded Devices Branch (EDB)`.
More information about this department you can find on [wikileaks][link_wikileaks_edb], also there is a [chart][link_wikileaks_chart_org]
shows structure of CIA.

## Extra speculations about developers and environment

`Miker` has got access to at list 2 machines:
* hive-builder.edb.devlan.net,
* stash.devlan.net.

The first one `hive-builder` looks like a machine for making binary releases.
Second one `stash` is a repo server. I have seen many commits with
description:
```
Merge branch 'idkey' of ssh://stash.devlan.net:7999/hive/hive into idkey
```

According to this speculation we can assume that `miker` has higher rank in
`EDB` than `jackmc`.

Moreover, I compared number of commit made by developers:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ cat out.txt | grep miker | wc -l
37
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ # 37
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ cat out.txt | grep jackmc | wc -l
308
```

`Jackmc` made much more commits but most of them show that he is a sloppy developer, small probe of changelog:

```

We have rapid development here and this descriptions are present in main branch.
Interesting is _his_ machine: `neutrino.edb.devlan.net`. I haven't found more information
about it.


# Code

First, sad information. History of repo starts from version `2.6.1`. According to initial comit repo
was moved from `subversion` into `git`. It was done in the simplest way, without care about past data.

More details about releases I found in `Hive 2.9 User's Guide`
(git object 1315c15d006e6783b208643602d85f423086e013) -- created on May 21, 2015 -- informantion
about first release: `10/26/2010, Initial Release v1.0, Authority TDR`. `02/14/2011` released `v1.0.2`
and according to notes it should work on all _supported_ architectures/systems:
* Windows,
* Linux/MikroTik MIPS,
* Linux/MikroTik PPC,
* Solaris 9-10 x86 & Linux x86.

## Repository hierarchy

In `common` directory we have `bzip2`, `polarssl` and `ssl` -- `OpenSouce` libraries.
`Client` is stored in `client` directory
and `server` I suppose that you can guess -- yes, inside `server`. Also, we have
`infrastructure`, `documentation` with _lyrics_. Moreover, `honeycomb` is  a server written in `python`, definitely
author is not a native python developer. In user guide we can find this note: _Honeycomb acts much like a
traditional iterative server that handles incoming beacon connections one-by-one._ I didn't focus on this code.
Finally, we have `snapshot_*` directories. In my opinion storing binary releases in `git` repo is bad idea.
It's worth mentioning that in `client/ctHive/ILMSDK` we have beautiful code in `C++`, mostly `XML` parser. Obviously
it wasn't made by this team.
The last but not the least, there is not tests here. If you are a programmer you should know what does it mean -- troubles.

## client and server review

`Hive` developers disappointed me. I expected something interesting
but we have in most places mess. Small example, `master` branch `client/misc.c`:
```c
void DisplayStatus(struct proc_vars* info) {
   int argc = 0;
   char* message;

//   fprintf(stdout, "\n****************************************************************\n\n");
   //fprintf(stdout, "\n %sSession configuration parameters:%s\n", BLUE, RESET);
   fprintf(stdout, "\n %s%s:%s\n", BLUE, sessionConfigParamString, RESET);

/*
   if (info->listen == NO) {
      fprintf(stdout, "   TCP socket type = connect (active)\n");
   } else {
      fprintf(stdout, "   TCP socket type = listen (passive)\n");
   }
*/

   if (info->interactive == YES) {
      //fprintf(stdout, "  . Interactive mode established\n");
//      fprintf(stdout, "%s", interactiveModeString);
   } else {
      if (info->ignore == NO) {
         //fprintf(stdout, "   Automatic mode established (not ignoring errors)\n");
         fprintf(stdout, "%s", automaticMode1String);
      } else {
         //fprintf(stdout, "   Automatic mode established (ignoring errors)\n");
         fprintf(stdout, "%s", automaticMode2String);
      }
      fprintf(stdout, "%s", message);
      free(message);
```
Variable `message` is not initialized and we print _something_ and we (sic!) release it. Madness.
Let's assume that is was accident. Maybe server looks better? Part of `server/client_session.c`:

```c
//******************************************************************
/*!
 * Download a file from the local system to the command post
 * @param path - complete path and filename
 * @param size - size of file
 * @param sock - socket
 * @return
 */
int DownloadFile(char *path, unsigned long size, int sock)
{
	REPLY ret;		// Reply struct
	unsigned char data[DATA_BUFFER_SIZE];
	struct stat buf;
	FILE *fd;
	int	bytes_read, bytes_written;

	//TODO: Review and fix/remove this.
	// to silence compiler warnings. this var no longer needed because of the 
	// ssl_context declared global to this file
	sock = sock;
```
Just take a look on comment `TODO` near `sock` and this assignment:
```
sock = sock;
```

Could be even worse? Yes, It just a beginning. `server/netstat_an.c`:
```c
//Called by beacon.c to release data 
void release_netstat_an(unsigned char* netstat_an)
{
	if(netstat_an != NULL)
	{
		free(netstat_an);
		netstat_an = NULL;
	}
	return;
}
```
They don't know that assign `NULL` it this case has no effect outside the function.
And this `return` on the end -- beautiful.

Yet another example of poor development -- `server/persistence.c`:
```c
int EnablePersistence(char* beaconIP, int beaconPort)
{
//TODO: just to silence the compiler warning
beaconIP++;
beaconPort++;

	return 0;
}
```
I'm curious why people store that code `server/decode_dns.h`:
```c
#if 0
// Broken code that isn't used anyway
typedef struct {
	char		name[NS_MAXDNAME];    // <--- this doesn't work here
	DNS_rr_data	rrmetadata;
	const u_char 	*rdata;
} DNS_rr;
#endif
```
Does author think that anybody uncomment it?

`server/survey_mac.c`:
```c
// lower three byte are psuedo-random
mac[3] = (unsigned char) (htonl(rand()) >> 24);
mac[4] = (unsigned char) (htonl(rand()) >> 24);
mac[5] = (unsigned char) (htonl(rand()) >> 24);
```
Definitely, call `htonl()` on `random()` makes result more random.

And my favorite one from `server/daemonize.c`:
```
int daemonize( void )
{
	int	i;
	pid_t	pid;
	char	devnull[10];

#ifdef SOLARIS
	// set process max core file size to zero.
	struct rlimit 	corelimit = { 0, 0 };
#endif

	devnull[0] = '/'; devnull[5] = 'n';
    devnull[1] = 'd'; devnull[6] = 'u';
    devnull[2] = 'e'; devnull[7] = 'l';
    devnull[3] = 'v'; devnull[8] = 'l';
    devnull[4] = '/'; devnull[9] = '\0';
```

`I h a v e n o i d e a w h a t I ' m d o i n g h e r e`. Clearly evidence
that `EDB` doesn't have any code review.

# Conclusion

We can laugh at poor code, but the truth is that this software works. In one year
they made product able to interact with most used systems/architectures.
According to _user guide_ the most problems they have with `Solaris` and `Linux` on `MIPS`, quote:
_As of Hive version 2.9, Solaris and MIPS little-endian architectures are no longer supported._
Moreover dump of repo comes from 2015 and we can assume that new versions were released.
I suppose that both mentioned developers right now are only maintainers of this code. They fix bugs, don't
add new features. Also, they should keep eye on new releases of _supported_ systems/architectures.

---

One thing just scared me. I expected much more from `wikileaks`, they didn't make properly data anonymization.
It is a real problem for whistleblowers.
