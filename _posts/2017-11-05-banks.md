title: "Banks"
---

In [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-29-trust %}) I wrote about
possibility of decryption `SSL` communication by _trusted certificate authority_.
I also mentioned about `Certum` and `Asseco`. I started looking deeper into that
and I found out that my bank uses more certificates. On the main page issuer
is `Certum (Unizeto)` but on side used to log into a bank account is used other certificate.

---
I've been thinking about it and the main question is: which certs are used and which are crucial?
So I will check it and make a list of all banks from Poland according
to [wikipedia page][link_wiki_banks] (warning: polish language). After that I
might _say something more_ about security. So, let's find out more.

# Technics

From mentioned page I took list of polish banks and reduced it using this criterion:
* bank has to have web page which allows log in into an account,
* I use links which follow to log in part of service not just main page.

I decided to focus on authentication pages because they are critical if we think about
bank security.

To gather data about certs I use simple method:
```
openssl s_client -connect <BANK_PAGE_HERE>:443
```

From a result we are interested:
* issuer of certificate, line starts with `issuer=`,
* country of issuer, also part of `issuer=`,
* certificate, to get [object identifier (OID)][link_oid] required to check [Extended Validation (EV)][link_ev].

Last part sounds terribly, but it's easy to obtain. We just process output of:
```
openssl s_client -connect <BANK_PAGE_HERE>:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | openssl x509 -text -noout
```
and take value of `Policy`. If present more than one policy I collect all of them. Example of OID: `2.16.840.1.113733.1.7.23.6`.
To find out what that _magic numbers_ mean I use service [oid-info.com][link_oid_info] to extract data.

# Data

Raw data looks like this listed under. I presented name of banks and their links not because it's an advert. With
that information you can verify my results. Data are sorted alphabetically by name of bank.

And one more view on the data. From my point of view more important. Data are sorted by number of _secured_ banks:

thawte|US|3
Unizeto Technologies S.A.|**PL**|3

# Conclusions

First, I was a little surprised when I saw result. I expected more banks supported by polish issuer `Unizeto Technologies S.A.`
Let's start from _bad_ things, even ridiculous.

One bank listed above uses _strange_ url address when you wish to see your account. It redirects you
to another domain which doesn't look like a page of a bank. It has EV with name of the bank but I was so confused when I saw
it first time.

**Each bank _secured_ by `Unizeto Technologies S.A` doesn't have EV**. What does it mean for a customer? When you visit
that page you see only information that it uses SSL, but there is no information about company (bank).
Why I complain about that? Many months ago started [Let's encrypt][link_lets_encyrpt], the idea is simple -- free encryption
for everyone. Cert is recognized by _main browsers_ and [usage of it is still growing up][link_nettrack_ssl]. It's a lofty
goal but it also has some consequences. Other issuers start _panic_ because they sell certs and from obvious reason
profit goes down. As well, how you can expect, quality of service falling down. Not so long time ago `Google` and `Symantec
Corporation` had [_small argue_][link_google_symantec] about certs. In other words, it's easy to miss _man in the middle attack_
when you only check that page _has a lock_. Right now it only means -- encrypted layer -- but it doesn't mean secure.

Most of issuers come from US. We have here also foreign banks which have branches, departments in Poland and how we
can see we didn't catch other countries. Certainly probe was very small but I suppose that we may say something about trend.
If we back to _main thread_ of this post we found out that: **most of banks in Poland uses US SSL issuers.**
And again we have some new food for thought. Is it good or is it bad? The answer I suppose is: _it depands_.
