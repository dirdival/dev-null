title: "PDF"
---

Last weekend I filled `PIT` (Personal Income Tax) declaration for the previous year.
Since 2010 I sent it over the network (`e-PIT`), but before that, I used to visit a tax office to stamp document. Year by year,
the whole procedure seems to be simpler, and it's a good direction.
I accustomed to use dedicated programs for `PIT`. For years I tested two that support `Linux`. Each time, I install such a program on `VirtualBox`,
with all _strange stuff_ required to call it on `Linux`.  Also, I stopped printing a filled document.
I store it in `PDF` (Portable Document Format) -- I'm sure that you know this format.

Why do you write about it? -- you may ask. There is a small problem with a document when I open it on another machine. It looks like this:

    Please wait...
    If this message is not eventually replaced by the proper contents of the document, your PDF
    viewer may not be able to display this type of document.
    You can upgrade to the latest version of Adobe Reader for Windows®, Mac, or Linux® by
    visiting http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html.
    For more assistance with Adobe Reader visit http://www.adobe.com/support/products/
    acrreader.html.

Had you seen that before? Yep, `PDF` is non-portable -- to me more specific -- `PDF` made by `Adobe Reader` doesn't follow ISO standard.
There are plenty of [`PDF` Linux viewers][link_pdf_readers], but only `Adobe Reader` can open self made documents. I know -- it supports forms,
editing, but I don't care. I want to make a backup of my `PIT` and open it on any machine.

How to deal with it? If you have access to a machine that has `Adobe Reader` you can generate a truly portable file. Here is a simple trick.
First, I use option _print_ and chose _Print to file_ with marked _print as image_. It generates a [`PostScript`][link_post_script] file.
It's portable and most of `PDF` readers also support this format. Second, if you need `PDF`, you may transform it into that
format with another small trick. An ordinary attempt doesn't work:

    dirdival@discworld:/tmp$ ps2pdf old.ps
    This PostScript file was created from an encrypted PDF file.
    Redistilling encrypted PDF is not permitted.

`Ghostscript` doesn't recognise `eexec`. Here is the trick:

    sed '/^%% Removing the following eleven lines is illegal.*/,+11 s|^|%% |' old.ps > new.ps

and the difference between files:

    dirdival@discworld:/tmp$ diff old.ps new.ps

How you can see, to not have problems with the law, we preserve all lines even with an extra comment on the beginning.
After that, `ps2pdf` just works:

    dirdival@discworld:/tmp$ ps2pdf new.ps 
    dirdival@discworld:/tmp$ ls new.pdf
    new.pdf

I hope you enjoyed this little trick.

BTW, did you know that by default `e-pity`, one of the most used programs in Poland to fill `PIT` declaration, sends your data to `Google Analytics`? How do you feel about it? Is it fine?
