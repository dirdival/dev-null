title: "Summary of reading - January 2018"

It's hard to find time to write something interesting and valuable about IT, but there is no
excuses to practice writing in English. Since a few weeks I'm focused on gathering data about
_new technologies_ -- I decided to buy and mount from scratch new desktop. The current one has
almost 10 years and surprisedly I can say that for ordinary use like codding, browsing internet
it's enough. I suppose that I will write more about new things which I learnt about hardware and set up
in near future.

To leave some mark that I'm still alive I share with you my summary of reading -- January 2018:
* _The Improbability Principle: Why Coincidences, Miracles, and Rare Events Happen Every Day_ by David J. Hand (ISBN 978-83-280-1733-7) --
If you are interested improbability, you are curious why impossible things happens, that book is for you. First part of the book is full
of interesting stories, describes paradoxes like _Birthday problem_. Seconds part try to prove that _The law of truly large numbers_ works.

* _The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye_ by David Lagercrantz (ISBN 978-83-8015-385-1) -- I've read all previous books from _Millennium series_ and
I couldn't miss this one. I looked forward to reading again about Lisbeth Salander. It's not the best book from whole series but I was enjoyed. BTW,
the first book _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_ by Stieg Larsson definitely is the best one.

* _Retoryka - Sztuka przekonywania_ by Cornelia Dietrich (ISBN 978-83-61059-13-4) -- My first meet with book about rhetoric. Without no doubt
it's not the book which I looked for. Too short, small examples, it looks like a bachelor paper.
