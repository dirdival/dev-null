title: "Strange talking"
---

The idea comes from Pawe≈Ç who said _If you wish improve yours English start
making meetings in that language_. I asked about this idea my team members and
they agreed that it might be educational and fun. Since more than 30 working days,
during stand-ups and sprints in my team we speak in English. It makes impact
on my work which I expected, but it also has unexpected consequences.

In my team we have to obey this two simple new rules:
* we speak only in English during meetings,
* if you don't understand a interlocutor he has to explain meaning of that
sentence in other words.

I have to admit that first few meetings were hard. We had to find a _common_
language. We have a different skill levels in spoken language (and in written too).
At the beginning was a lot of sentences: _I don't get it. Could you explain it?_
, etc. Also, how you can imagine we were a little shy. People were looking at us,
because it's unusual at work to speak in foreign language if you don't talk with
a guest or a customer.

More or less after a week, we accustomed to _strange talking_ meetings. Stand-ups
have strict parts like: describe what you are doing right now, talk about progress
in task or problems, etc. 

The time has come for small summary of this experiment.

Advantages:
* obvious, we are improving our language skills, in spoken and writen language,
* and unexpected, meetings are more focused on _theme_, because our skills
right now don't allow us talk _about everything_.

Drawbacks:
* meetings are a little longer -- especially on the beginning, when you search _common_
language. Also, from time to time you have to explain some _new_ word of sentence,
* is much, much harder to tell a joke. You might think that it's not important,
but meeting should not be stressful or boring. Small chit chat at the end not related to
work it's good idea.

We have here ambiguous situation: we are more focused on meetings but they are
insipid. In other words, meetings are not _fun_ like team members expected.
The main question is: do I have to do _something_ with that? Does _boring_ meeting
might be a problem?

We are going to proceed _strange talking_ meetings. I suppose that when we _achieve_ some
higher level in speaking than stand-up becomes _fun_. We will see.
