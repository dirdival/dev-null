title: "Hive"
---

9th of November [wikileaks published][link_wikileaks_hive] git repository with
source code of Hive. It's a client/server solution uses SSL to encrypt
data and split VPN communication into two paths -- one for _known users_ (CIA)
and second for _not known_ which see cover server. I'm not going to describe
here in details how it works, if you are interested just follow to mentioned
page. Also, you can find there [documents][link_wikileaks_hive_docs] which are
part of git repository -- mostly user guides without a code for non technical
persons.

---

Because I'm a programmer and I'm just curious _how do they do it?_ I will try find
out more about that repo. First, I decided split this _article_ into two parts:
* metadata -- find out as much as possible about authors, environment and used
tools,
* source code -- shape of it, order of work, code style, etc.

This post focuses only on metadata, in the next week will be second part.

# Basic information from git

To start just grab the [zipped git repo][link_wikileaks_git_repo]. After extract
we enter into it and ... we see nothing, OK there is a hidden `.git` folder:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ ls -a
.  ..  .git
```

Let's check what git say:

```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git status | head -n 10
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    deleted:    .cproject
    deleted:    .project
    deleted:    Doxyfile
    deleted:    Makefile
    deleted:    README
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git status | wc -l
921
```
So, somebody decided to remove all files and just leaved hidden repository `.git`.
Interesting idea, I'm not sure is it a _clever_ solution but for non technical
people it might be a challenge.

First, we have to clean up a mess:

```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git reset --hard
HEAD is now at b6ac4fd User's Guide date corrections.
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

Done. The time has come find out what we have here. We start from branches and tags:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git branch 
  armv5
  autotools
  debug
  dhm
  makemods

```

First observation -- a repository is quite _old_. Last commit comes from 2015:
```
commit b6ac4fd7cdeac91bb8425b9f9df49bda4411186b
Author: User #142 <Account.156@devlan.net>
Date:   Fri Oct 30 09:58:22 2015 -0400

    User's Guide date corrections.
```
and the first one:
```
commit cd32369f329cef1a4f185e42024b9d58a2a31792
Author: User #226 <Account.234@devlan.net>
Date:   Thu Aug 8 15:33:44 2013 -0400

    Hive version 2.6.1 as of 8 August 2013 as pulled from old repository https://teamforge.devlan.net/svn/repos/hive/tags/hive-2.6.1.  A lot of the old directories have been removed to simplify future builds using git.  All subversion directories have been removed.
```
We have more than 2 years of development here.
Finally, address of repository:
```
ssh://stash.devlan.net:7999/hive/hive
```
mentioned many times in merge commits.

# Users and working hours

How many developers work on Hive?
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git log | grep '^Author' | sort | uniq
Author: User #140 <Account.155@devlan.net>
Author: User #142 <Account.156@devlan.net>
Author: User #217 <Account.227@devlan.net>
Author: User #226 <Account.233@devlan.net>
Author: User #226 <Account.234@devlan.net>
Author: User #226 <Account.235@devlan.net>
```
We have `6` accounts, but user IDs repeats. What does it mean? I suppose that
they made copy/paste of git configuration and they changed only account
numbers. Can we assume that in that department works at least 235 developers?
Can we assume that a higher number means junior employees? Let it be: so, we
have 2 veterans and 4 newbies.

When do they work and how often make a new commit?

```
It gives use more or less one commit per 2 days in main branch. I check with
grep all hours and the earliest commit comes from:
```
commit 471078b8d7522f19792e29e74140de6f32f9e49d
Author: User #142 <Account.156@devlan.net>
Date:   Thu Jun 5 07:22:10 2014 -0400

    Changes to fix build issues with debugging.
```
and the latest is:
```
commit 0265ca26c2c7f1765ab7c87b60a06a8a5587d2bd
Author: User #226 <Account.234@devlan.net>
Date:   Thu Aug 8 17:10:47 2013 -0400

    Trunk as pulled from the old repository https://teamforge.devlan.net/svn/repos/hive/trunk cleaned up on 8 August 2013 with the infrastructure branch added.  All future development should occur here using git.
```
Small observation: this commit is a second commit in the repo (just after the
init version) and was made in the same day.

I didn't found commits from Saturday nor Sunday, so it looks like a ordinary
work in the office. Moreover, we have information about timezone in each commit,
for example:
```
Date:   Fri Jan 10 15:20:53 2014 -0500
Date:   Fri Nov 22 14:34:03 2013 -0500
```
The `-0500` means `UTC` time minus 5 hours. I check that and it might
be (surprise) -- `Washington DC`, `Miami`, `New York` -- east USA. 

# Data, environment, programs ... and more data

## Data

List all the files that ever existed in a Git repository:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ git log --pretty=format: --name-status | cut -f2- | sort -u > /tmp/all_files.txt
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ cat /tmp/all_files.txt | wc -l
2798
````
and their extensions:
```
.1 .3des .a .aes128 .aes192 .aes256 .arch .arm .attr .bak .blurb .bsh .bz2 .c .C
 .cc .cfg .com .conf .cpp .crt .csr .css .data .def .des .dll .dsp .dsw .exe
 .filters .fmt .gch .gz .h .hive .html .jpg .key .lib .log .mak .md5 .mipsel
 .msc .o .odp .odt .out .pdf .pem .pfx .pl .prefs .prj .project .ps .pub
 .py .pyc .ref .sh .sln .STUFF .tar .tcl .tgz .txt .user .vcproj .vcxproj .vpj
 .vpw .xml .xs
```
Most of files come from OpenSource projects. But what they really did we find
out in next week.

Sometimes developers are sloppy and they just commit things which should not be
part of repository: object files, compiled binary data, configuration of programs, etc.
Let's find them to determine used programs end environment.

## Programs


```
commit 54bb023b7b95908455dddbc1b4ca984cd484e095
Author: User #140 <Account.155@devlan.net>
Date:   Tue Aug 20 10:31:52 2013 -0400

    Added files and directories related to Eclipse IDE.
```
They don't hides. If you are interested more see file:
```
.cproject
```
in main repo directory. 
Also we have `server/.settings/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.prefs`:
```
eclipse.preferences.version=1
org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.errnoreturn=Warning
org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.errnoreturn.params={launchModes\=>{RUN_ON_FULL_BUILD\=>true,RUN_ON_INC_BUILD\=>true,RUN_ON_FILE_OPEN\=>false,RUN_ON_FILE_SAVE\=>false,RUN_AS_YOU_TYPE\=>true,RUN_ON_DEMAND\=>true},implicit\=>false}
org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.errreturnvalue=Error
org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.errreturnvalue.params={launchModes\=>{RUN_ON_FULL_BUILD\=>true,RUN_ON_INC_BUILD\=>true,RUN_ON_FILE_OPEN\=>false,RUN_ON_FILE_SAVE\=>false,RUN_AS_YOU_TYPE\=>true,RUN_ON_DEMAND\=>true}}
...
```

Part of file `client/ssl/polarssl-0.14.0-pre-patches/README`:
```
-- COMPILING
There are currently three active build systems within the PolarSSL releases:
 - Make
 - CMake
 - Microsoft Visual Studio
...
--- Microsoft Visual Studio
The build files for Microsoft Visual Studio are generated for Visual Studio 6.0 all future Visual Studio's should be able to open and use this older version of the build files.
```
and small prove.  We can find many `dsp` files
```
$ find -name '*.dsp' | wc -l
22
```
They start from
```
 Microsoft Developer Studio Project File - Name="sha1sum" - Package Owner=<4>
# Microsoft Developer Studio Generated Build File, Format Version 6.00
# ** DO NOT EDIT **
```
and more
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ cat server/cryptcat/cryptcat.sln

Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 11.00
# Visual Studio 2010
Project("{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}") = "cryptcat", "cryptcat.vcxproj", "{766CE45E-FC38-40B3-910A-34E72DEBBD7E}"
EndProject
Global
    GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution
        Debug|Win32 = Debug|Win32
```
and much more: `server/polarssl-0.14.0/visualc/aescrypt2.vcproj`
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="Windows-1252"?>
<VisualStudioProject
    ProjectType="Visual C++"
    Version="8.00"
    Name="aescrypt2"
    ProjectGUID="{484F1631-1185-47AA-887E-65BC19355E8E}"
    RootNamespace="aescrypt2"
    >
```

I also found a strange for me `.mak` extension and that file contains configuration
for [`SlickEdit`][link_slick_edit]:
```
# SlickEdit generated file.  Do not edit this file except in designated areas.
```
and `.vpj` files with project configuration:
```
<!DOCTYPE Project SYSTEM "http://www.slickedit.com/dtd/vse/10.0/vpj.dtd">
<Project
    Version="10.0"
    VendorName="SlickEdit"
    WorkingDir="."
    BuildSystem="automakefile"
    BuildMakeFile="%rp%rn.mak"
    VCSProject='SCC:Surround SCM SCCI:"SurroundSCMScci"'
    VCSLocalPath="SCC:Surround SCM SCCI:C:\Dev\JY008C637-ILM_SDK\1_1"
    VCSAuxPath="SurroundSCMScci">
...
```

And the last one tool which is worth mentioning.
Script for indentation `server/cryptcat-c-port/indent.sh` uses `indent`:
```
#!/bin/sh

indent --blank-lines-after-declarations         \   
       --blank-lines-after-procedures           \   
       --swallow-optional-blank-lines           \   
       --blank-lines-before-block-comments      \ 
...
```

## Environment

Can we determine used system? Yes we can.
There are few files `.o` from `client/ssl/polarssl-0.14.0` 
(changeset 9e92609a43890ee6ec0a72d5f0b85a8cd85c5856)
and they were generated by:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ strings client/ssl/polarssl-0.14.0/library/arc4.o
GCC: (GNU) 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-51)
```

A `pyc` files help recognize python version:
```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ file ./server/mod_hexify.pyc
./server/mod_hexify.pyc: python 2.4 byte-compiled
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ file ./client/mod_hexify.pyc
./client/mod_hexify.pyc: python 2.4 byte-compiled
```
Also, we have very interesing document which gives us info about `LibreOffice`:
```
Title:          Hive Engineering Development Guide
Creator:        Writer
Producer:       LibreOffice 3.5
```
It describes problems with getting time after boot on different machines -- it's
crutial to get valid date because `Hive` deletes self after 60 days.

I searched any linux home directories and I found hundreds hits.
```
git grep '\<home\>'  $(git rev-list --all) > /tmp/home.txt
```
Most of them uses account `miker`, small probe:

```
INPUT                  = /home/miker/codeDevelopment/projects/gitolite/hive/trunk/ilm-client/resetTimer_v1.0
/home/miker/tempPayload
/home/miker/tempInstall
touch -r /export/home/tempPayload  /export/home/hived-solaris-sparc-PATCHED 2>/dev/null

```
There are more one hits but I suppose they are not strict connected with `Hive`,
like this one from the first commit:
```
ilm-client/xterm-notes.txt:pushd /home/jeremy/sourceforge/hive/trunk/ilm-client/ && gnome-terminal --geometry=75x25 -t "Hive Shell" -e "./cutthroat hive"; popd
```

I also found windows paths but most of them are useless:
```
hinstLib = LoadLibrary(TEXT("C:\\work\\dlltest\\HiveServerDLL.dll"))
```
from `server/DllTestLoader/dlltestloadermain.c`


## ... More data

I went through few `readme` files. In this section you can find small sumary of
used data.

Part of `client/ssl/CA/README`:
```
Procedure for Changing/Embedding certs and keys within Hive/PolarSSL:

* application must include polarssl/certs.h (libs/crypto.c does this)

for only one time, or as needed:
* create a Certificate Authority (at this time, the mygen.sh script will generate
a new CA each time it is run, in addition to creating client/server keys and certs
* the Certificate Authority's certificate are built into the hive-client 
and implants (TBD)
```
I checked mentioned certificate and others. Just take a look on
`cient/ssl/CA/client.crt`:
```
Certificate:
    Data:

```
Some guys have obsession with `Kaspersky`. More evidence:

```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ cat /tmp/all_files.txt | grep -i kaspersky
client/ssl/CA/examples/activation.kaspersky.com
client/ssl/CA/examples/my.kaspersky.com
client/ssl/CA/examples/support.kaspersky.com
client/ssl/CA/examples/www.kaspersky.com
client/ssl/CA/kaspersky.conf

```

I checked all `XML` files but first they are obscured with `base64` and second
they are not interesting. Small example of content, it looks like GUI part
-- _What did you expect from CSS.xml?_:

```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ cat snapshot_20140506-1200/ctDirectory/CCS.xml | base64 -d | head -n 10
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<commoncommandset version="2.2">
  <cmdgrp title="module">
    <cmdgrp title="persist">
      <cmd title="enable">
        <helptext>Moves the module into persistent non-volatile storage on the target.  Add invisible attribute.</helptext>
        <primitives>
          <required_primitives>
            <primitive>0x07000003</primitive>
          </required_primitives>
...
```

I also went through all `conf`, `cfg` files and I think that this one is the
most interesting. Whole `infrastructure/scripts/redirect.conf`:
```
DEBUG=1

outside_interface=eth0
inside_interface=eth1
tunnel_interface=tun0

VPN_PORT=43653
ADMIN_PORT=29610

PUBLIC_IP=78.47.131.68
PRIVATE_IP=91.93.104.178
TUNNEL_IP=10.177.77.1


#VDNS_PORT=5302
VHTTP_PORT=8002
VHTTPS_PORT=44302
```

I checked history of that file and `PUBLIC_IP` were never changed. Let's check it:

```
dirdival@pld:/tmp/hive$ whois 78.47.131.68

```

Finaly we end with IP adresses. I greped all files searching for IPv4 and
again we have hundreds of hits.
We have some clues about internal network from `honeycomb/owt/swift_upload.py`:
```
#default_feeder_ip = '10.249.91.60' #O
default_feeder_ip = '172.20.17.51' #Icon
#default_feeder_ip = '172.24.2.41' #TDN

#default_feeder_ip = '192.168.230.11' #BigMac
#default_feeder_ip = '192.168.254.9' #BAR
```
I also selected some _interesting_ IP and localizations according to the file `honeycomb/processRSI.py`:
```

On the end small announcement of future post. Section from
`documentation/DevelopersGuide/DevelopersGuide.pdf`:
```
Discrepancy report DR-00134-2012 was issued after Operations determined that Hive version 2.5 was
self-deleting prematurely. Analysis showed that a calculation involving the current time and the file
modification time used to determine the time since last contact could result in a negative number that
was then cast from an integer to an unsigned long integer. This resulted in a large positive number that
exceeded the delete delay and subsequently caused Hive to self-delete.
