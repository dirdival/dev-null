title: "games on Linux"

The funny thing is that, even when you are an adult, from time to time you have a mood to play computer games. That's the fact. From obvious reason
you don't have as much time as before when you was a teenager. If it's not a way to _avoid_ problems/forget about real life then _fine_, you can play.

I suppose that programmers have a _little easier_ then _non technical_ people. We continually work with computer,
[mostly our set is quite new]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-18-discworld %}) and is able to start even new AAA games. There is a lot of good and
free _stuff_ in each Linux distribution. Great, I really appreciate it, I've played many, many times on Linux: [`Cube 2` (then call `Sauerbraten`)][link_cube2],
[`Teeworlds`][link_teeworlds], [`foobilard`][link_foobilard], [`SuperTux`][link_supertux] and dozens more.

But, sporadically you wish to play something different, something new. Perhaps you've seen a trailer of a new game, or you had a small chit-chat about games.
Then you decided to buy it but there is a _small problem_ -- big companies really rarely release new games with Linux platform support.

To be honest, many good things happened during last years with Linux support for games, but we are still on the beginning of a journey.
In last month according to [`Steam` we had a 0.28% of market share][link_phoronix_steam].
Yes, I agree, we are talking here about a tiny part of game market. I can't imagine that some CEO after that report may say:
_We can gain 0,28% much more money,if we start releasing software for Linux platform, let's do it!_ It doesn't work in this way. Many Linux users, mostly on `Steam`
visit community hub of a game and leave similar comments: _When Linux platform support will be present? You missed something - Linux platform support,_, etc. I'm
thankful them, even if many times others call them _trolls_. Does any game publisher read and care that comments? I don't think so.

Many years ago I decided to use only Linux as an operating system. Then I also decided to play only on it, without any exceptions. It's kind of a crusade.
I know how hard it is, but I think that it's the only one way to show that we exist. If you buy games for other platforms then we lose.
I can imagine a community of Linux users work together month by month. They make a survey, they chose some game and they buy it -- each of them.
It might be even 1000 people. Is it feasible or just a dream?
